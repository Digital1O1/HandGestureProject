**Game Plan Moving Forward**
===========================

### Phase 1: Data Preparation

#### 1. Finalize CSV Data Collection
- Complete the C++ program to write values properly.
- Manually label gestures in the CSV file or automate it with user input.

### Phase 2: Model Selection and Training

#### 2. Preprocess Data for Model Training
- Load the CSV file into Python using Pandas.
- Normalize/scale the data if needed.
- Split into training and testing sets.

#### 3. Select Model Type
- Start with a traditional machine learning model (Random Forest, SVM, or k-NN).
- If accuracy is low, move to a deep learning approach (CNNs with TensorFlow/PyTorch).

### Phase 3: Model Evaluation and Deployment

#### 4. Train and Evaluate the Model
- Train the model on extracted features.
- Test accuracy using a validation dataset.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.

#### 5. Deploy the Model in Real-Time
- Integrate the trained model into a live hand-tracking pipeline in OpenCV.
- Run real-time inference to classify gestures.
