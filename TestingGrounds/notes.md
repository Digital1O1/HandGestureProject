# Big idea with this folder
## Use this to test out code 
- Main intention is to leave the other folders strictly for what they're named after.
  - Example : `SkinSegmentation` should only have stuff that's related to the topic and nothing more

# Currently testing
- Testing out background subtraction methods and using `YCrCb` color plane
