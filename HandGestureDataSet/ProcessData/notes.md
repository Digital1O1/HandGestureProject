# Recommended Models for Hand Gesture Classification
## Assumptions

*   You extracted feature vectors like convex hull count, convexity defects, aspect ratio, area, etc.
*   You're not feeding raw images but engineered features from those images.

## Model Recommendation Summary

### A. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

| **Characteristics** | **Pros**                                   | **Cons**                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Use When...         | Quick, accurate classification on features | Needs scaling and kernel tuning |

*   Highly effective on small datasets with engineered features.
*   Robust to high-dimensional data.
*   Works well with binary (fist vs. number 1) or multi-class classification.

### B. Random Forest Classifier

| **Characteristics** | **Pros**                      | **Cons**          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Use When...         | Interpretability + robustness | Larger model size |

*   Great for interpreting which features matter most.
*   Handles nonlinear decision boundaries.
*   Resistant to overfitting on small to medium datasets.

### C. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

| **Characteristics** | **Pros**   | **Cons**         |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Use When...         | Simplicity | Slower inference |

*   Extremely simple to implement.
*   No training time — just memory-based.

### D. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP / Feedforward Neural Net)

| **Characteristics** | **Pros**                  | **Cons**                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Use When...         | Modeling complex patterns | Needs more data and tuning |

*   Can model complex patterns.
*   Needs more data than SVM or Random Forest.
*   Requires normalization and tuning.

### Bonus: Logistic Regression

| **Characteristics** | **Pros**             | **Cons**      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Use When...         | Lightweight and fast | Limited power |

*   Lightweight and fast.
*   Doesn't capture nonlinear decision boundaries well.

## Overview of Required Preprocessing for SVM

### Step 1: Read & Combine All CSVs

*   Combine all your gesture CSVs (closeFist_1.csv, numberOne_1.csv, etc.)
*   Make sure they all have the same column structure
*   Add a numerical label for each unique gesture

```python
import pandas as pd
import glob

# Load and combine all CSVs
csv_files = glob.glob("*.csv")
df_list = []

for file in csv_files:
    temp = pd.read_csv(file)
    temp["label"] = file.split("_")[0]  # Extract "closeFist", "numberOne", etc.
    df_list.append(temp)

df = pd.concat(df_list, ignore_index=True)
```

### Step 2: Drop Unnecessary Columns

*   Don't want gesture_label (the filename) in your feature matrix. Drop it:

```python
df = df.drop(columns=["gesture_label"])
```

### Step 3: Encode String Labels as Integers

*   SVMs don’t understand strings as class labels.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

encoder = LabelEncoder()
df["label"] = encoder.fit_transform(df["label"])
```

### Step 4: Split Features and Labels

*   X = df.drop(columns=["label"]).values  # Feature matrix
*   y = df["label"].values                 # Label vector

```python
X = df.drop(columns=["label"]).values
y = df["label"].values
```

### Step 5: Scale the Features (IMPORTANT for SVM)

*   SVMs are sensitive to the scale of input features.

Use StandardScaler to scale features to zero mean and unit variance:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### Step 6: Train-Test Split

*   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

Split your data into training and testing sets:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 7: Train SVM

*   Try different kernels (linear or rbf) to see which one works best for your dataset:

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1e3, gamma='scale')
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model

*   Use classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of your model.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

y_pred = svm.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Summary of Your Preprocessing Tasks:

| Step | Task                   | Notes                         |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1    | Read and merge CSVs    | Use glob and pandas           |
| 2    | Drop non-feature cols  | Drop gesture_label            |
| 3    | Convert labels to ints | Use LabelEncoder              |
| 4    | Split X and y          | Features vs labels            |
| 5    | Scale the features     | SVM must have scaled features |
| 6    | Split train/test sets  | Standard 80/20 split          |
| 7    | Train SVM              | Try linear, rbf kernels       |
| 8    | Evaluate               | Use classification report     |

Remember to adjust your preprocessing steps and model parameters based on the specific requirements of your dataset.
